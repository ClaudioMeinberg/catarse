      title_one: "What inspired you to make this campaign?"

      title_five: "Have you thought about the campaign rewards?"
      tip_five: "Remember that rewards are public promises. So, think very well when elaborating them, as well as the logistics in delivering them to your backers. Our suggestion: think about immaterial rewards: downloads, experiences, courses e kisses."
      title_six: "Is your video ready?"
      tip_six: "The video is the business card of your campaign. It's through it that the backers will get in touch with your cause. So, take special care in the script, audio and image quality. HD is recommended."
      title_seven: "How will you mobilize your network?"
      tip_seven: "You need to have a clear idea on how you will stir your network and convince it to back your campaign. Distribute your work weekly and change your approach with the network according to how close you are to it."
      title_eight: "How will the money be used?"
