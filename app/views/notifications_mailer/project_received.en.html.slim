|Hi, #{user.name}!
br
br
|Thank you very much for trusting #{Configuration[:company_name]} with your campaign:)
br
br
|Before we begin, we would like to remind you how the campaign selection works here on #{Configuration[:company_name]}. There are 4 steps:
br
br
|1 - You just filled that beatiful form and we received it;
br
br
|2 - Our team will answer you in up to 5 working days. It's not necessarily a Yes or No answer, we will certainly exchange some emails before the project goes online.
br
br
|3 - When your campaign is ready, we will send you a special link to submit your project;
br
br
|4 - You will then need to tell us that the project has been submitted and we will authorize it so everyone can see and back it (if they want to, right?).
br
br
|Important information: if you forgot to include something in the submitted form, no problems, you can add new information (or change them) when our team contact you.
br
br
|Meanwhile, take a look at some other campaigns (#{link_to "#{Configuration[:base_url]}/explore" ,"#{Configuration[:base_url]}/explore"}) and - if you like them- make a purchase! This is the best way to show that you believe in the fanfuel vision and promote the ecosystem around #{Configuration[:company_name]}. Not to mention, getting some inspiration for your own campaign.
br
br
|Stay tuned to #{Configuration[:company_name]} on  #{link_to 'Facebook', Configuration[:facebook_url]} and #{link_to 'Twitter', "twitter.com/#{Configuration[:twitter_username]}" } and know more about #{Configuration[:company_name]} reading our posts on #{link_to 'blog', Configuration[:blog_url]}.
br
br
|If you have any questions, contact us on: #{mail_to Configuration[:email_contact]}
br
br
|A big thanks,
br
br
|#{Configuration[:company_name]} Team
