|Hello #{backer.user.name},
br
br
|Unfortunately the campaign #{link_to(backer.project.name, "#{Configuration[:base_url]}/projects/#{backer.project.to_param}")} that you backed did not reach its goal and wasn't successful on #{Configuration[:company_name]}.
br
br
|Because of this you received #{backer.display_value} in credits to back other campaigns.
br
br
|If you prefer, you can ask for a refund by clicking #{link_to("here", "#{Configuration[:base_url]}/users/#{backer.user.to_param}#credits")}. If you have any trouble with this process, send an email to #{mail_to Configuration[:email_payments]} with the subject “Refunds - login issues”.
br
br
|Back key: #{backer.key}
br
br
|If you choose to be refunded remember that, as stated on  #{link_to("Termo and Conditions of #{Configuration[:company_name]}","#{Configuration[:base_url]}/terms")}, it will be evaluated on a case by case basis. Unsuccessful projects will be refunded without major issues.
br
br
|If for any reason you want to contact #{backer.project.user.display_name}, send an email to #{mail_to backer.project.user.email}.
br
br
|If you have any questions, access our #{link_to('FAQ',"#{Configuration[:base_url]}/faq")} or send an email to #{mail_to Configuration[:email_payments]}.
br
br
|Thanks,
br
br
|#{Configuration[:company_name]} team
